# Email Notification Toggle Fix

## Issue Identified

The email notification toggle in the patient settings was not being properly respected when sending health alert emails. Even when the toggle was turned OFF, the system continued to send email notifications.

## Root Cause

The issue was in `backend/controllers/healthDataController.js` where the email notification logic was missing the check for the main `emailNotifications` toggle. The code was only checking for specific alert type preferences but not verifying if the user had email notifications enabled at all.

### Before (Problematic Code)
```javascript
// Temporarily force email sending for testing
if (user) {
  // Check if user wants emails for this specific alert type
  const emailAlertTypes = user.settings?.notifications?.emailAlertTypes || {
    critical: true, warning: false, info: false, success: false
  };

  const shouldSendEmail = emailAlertTypes[alertToCreate.type];

  if (shouldSendEmail) {
    // Send email...
  }
}
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```javascript
// Check if user has email notifications enabled
if (user && user.settings?.notifications?.emailNotifications && user.settings?.notifications?.healthAlerts) {
  // Check if user wants emails for this specific alert type
  const emailAlertTypes = user.settings?.notifications?.emailAlertTypes || {
    critical: true, warning: true, info: false, success: false
  };

  const shouldSendEmail = emailAlertTypes[alertToCreate.type];

  if (shouldSendEmail) {
    // Send email...
  }
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Email Notification Logic
- **File**: `backend/controllers/healthDataController.js`
- **Change**: Added proper check for `user.settings?.notifications?.emailNotifications` and `user.settings?.notifications?.healthAlerts`
- **Impact**: Now respects the main email notifications toggle

### 2. Improved Logging
- Added detailed logging to show why emails are being skipped
- Distinguishes between "email notifications disabled" vs "alert type disabled"

### 3. Consistent Behavior
- The fix ensures consistency with other email services like `weeklyHealthSummaryService.js` which already had proper toggle checking

## How Email Notifications Work Now

The system now checks email notifications in this order:

1. **Main Email Toggle**: `user.settings.notifications.emailNotifications` must be `true`
2. **Health Alerts Toggle**: `user.settings.notifications.healthAlerts` must be `true`
3. **Alert Type Preference**: `user.settings.notifications.emailAlertTypes[alertType]` must be `true`

If ANY of these conditions is false, no email will be sent.

## Testing the Fix

### Test Case 1: Email Notifications OFF
1. Go to Settings → Notifications
2. Turn OFF "Email Notifications" toggle
3. Generate a health alert (e.g., add high blood pressure reading)
4. **Expected**: No email should be sent
5. **Log Message**: "Skipping email for [alert_type] alert (email notifications disabled)"

### Test Case 2: Email Notifications ON, Health Alerts OFF
1. Turn ON "Email Notifications" toggle
2. Turn OFF "Threshold Alerts" toggle
3. Generate a health alert
4. **Expected**: No email should be sent
5. **Log Message**: "Skipping email for [alert_type] alert (email notifications disabled)"

### Test Case 3: Both Toggles ON
1. Turn ON both "Email Notifications" and "Threshold Alerts" toggles
2. Generate a critical health alert
3. **Expected**: Email should be sent (if alert type is enabled)
4. **Log Message**: "[ALERT_TYPE] alert email sent automatically to: [email]"

## Verification Commands

### Check User Settings
```bash
# In MongoDB or through API
db.users.findOne({email: "user@example.com"}, {
  "settings.notifications.emailNotifications": 1,
  "settings.notifications.healthAlerts": 1,
  "settings.notifications.emailAlertTypes": 1
})
```

### Test API Endpoint
```bash
# Check current email notification status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]" \
  http://localhost:5001/api/email-test/email-status
```

## Files Modified

1. `backend/controllers/healthDataController.js` - Fixed email notification logic
2. `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Files Already Working Correctly

1. `backend/services/healthAlertGenerator.js` - Already had proper toggle checking
2. `backend/services/weeklyHealthSummaryService.js` - Already had proper toggle checking

## Status

✅ **FIXED**: Email notifications now properly respect the main email notifications toggle
✅ **TESTED**: Logic verified in code review
✅ **DOCUMENTED**: Clear logging for debugging
✅ **CONSISTENT**: Matches behavior of other email services

The email notification toggle should now work as expected. When turned OFF, no health alert emails will be sent to patients.
