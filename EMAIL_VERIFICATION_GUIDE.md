# Email Verification with OTP - Implementation Guide

## Overview

I've successfully implemented email verification with OTP (One-Time Password) for both patient and doctor signup forms in your PulseMate application. This feature ensures that users can only proceed with registration after verifying their email address.

## Features Implemented

### Backend Features
- **OTP Generation**: 6-digit random OTP generation using crypto module
- **Email Service**: Professional email templates with OTP delivery via nodemailer
- **Security**: 5-minute OTP expiration, 3 attempt limit, duplicate email prevention
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - `POST /api/auth/send-otp` - Send OTP to email
  - `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` - Verify OTP code

### Frontend Features
- **Email Verification Component**: Reusable React component for both dashboards
- **Real-time Validation**: Email verification required before proceeding to next step
- **User Experience**: 
  - Countdown timer showing OTP expiration
  - Resend functionality with cooldown period
  - Visual feedback for verification status
  - Automatic email field locking after verification

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User enters email address in signup form
2. User clicks "Verify Email" button
3. OTP input field appears below email field
4. System sends 6-digit OTP to user's email
5. User enters OTP in the input field
6. System verifies OTP and marks email as verified
7. User can proceed to next step only after verification

### Security Features
- **OTP Expiration**: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- **Attempt Limiting**: Maximum 3 verification attempts
- **Email Locking**: Email field becomes read-only after verification
- **Reset on Change**: Verification resets if user changes email address
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents sending OTP to already registered emails

## Email Template

The OTP email includes:
- Professional PulseMate branding
- Clear 6-digit OTP code
- Expiration time (5 minutes)
- Security warning about not sharing the code
- Responsive HTML design with fallback plain text

## API Testing

### Send OTP
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/send-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com"}'
```

### Verify OTP
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/verify-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@example.com","otp":"123456"}'
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend Files
- `backend/controllers/authController.js` - Added OTP functions
- `backend/services/emailService.js` - Added OTP email templates
- `backend/routes/authRoutes.js` - Added OTP routes

### Frontend Files
- `patient-health-dashboard/src/components/ui/EmailVerification.jsx` - New component
- `doctor-dashboard/src/components/ui/EmailVerification.jsx` - New component
- `patient-health-dashboard/src/components/registration/Step1PersonalInfo.jsx` - Updated
- `doctor-dashboard/src/components/registration/Step1PersonalInfo.jsx` - Updated
- `patient-health-dashboard/src/pages/SignupPage.jsx` - Updated validation
- `doctor-dashboard/src/pages/SignupPage.jsx` - Updated validation

## Configuration

The system uses your existing nodemailer configuration from the `.env` file:
- `EMAIL_USER` - Gmail address for sending emails
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD` - Gmail app password
- `EMAIL_FROM` - From address for emails

## Testing Status

✅ **Backend API**: Both send-otp and verify-otp endpoints working correctly
✅ **Email Delivery**: OTP emails being sent successfully via Gmail
✅ **Error Handling**: Invalid OTP, expired OTP, and attempt limiting working
✅ **Frontend Integration**: Components created and integrated into signup forms
✅ **Validation**: Users cannot proceed without email verification
✅ **Auto-Send Fix**: OTP now automatically sends when "Verify Email" is clicked
✅ **User Experience**: Loading states and feedback messages implemented

## Next Steps

The email verification system is now fully functional. Users will need to:
1. Enter their email address
2. Click "Verify Email" 
3. Check their email for the OTP
4. Enter the 6-digit code
5. Successfully verify before proceeding to the next signup step

The system prevents users from bypassing email verification, ensuring all registered users have valid, verified email addresses.
